# Progress Log

Plain-language record of what's been built and decided, newest first. Git history has the detail; this is the map. Metric-producing runs go in [`EXPERIMENTS.md`](./EXPERIMENTS.md); decisions in [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md).

## Status at a glance

- **Phase 0 (Instrument):** eval harness ✅ · calibration tool ✅ · **open:** labeled eval sets + a calibrated court on *raw* footage.
- **Gate:** needs raw, uncut footage for rally labeling → then Phase 0.5 (prior-art benchmark) and Phase 0.6 (the dead-time gate).
- `main` is ahead of `origin` (local, unpushed).

## 2026-08-06 — Calibration hardened

- **`calibrate.py` is now order-independent and orientation-safe** (ADR-035). Clicking the 12 court points in any order works; a real 28.2 ft mis-ordered calibration recovered to **0.36 ft**. Verified on a fresh run (0.356 ft, orientation correct). 15 tests green. Merged to `main`.
- **Decision:** detection runs in court coordinates; per-court calibration absorbs camera pose (incl. elevation) but not occlusion — track players by their feet (ADR-036).
- **Decision:** two-sided detection — a live-play marker list weighed against the stopped-play list, no marker decides alone (ADR-037). Motivated by lob/wide chases tripping "left court" and dinks tripping "all stationary" during live play. Phase 0.6 now measures both marker directions.
- The 2023 PPA highlights clip served as the calibration test bed only. It stays unusable for rally *detection* (edited, dead time removed).

## 2026-08-05 — Phase 0 eval harness

- Built `eval/harness.py`: temporal-IoU one-to-one matching → detection metrics (recall, FP/10 min, boundary error) + selection metrics (budget, utilization, count, keep rate), per PRD §5 / TECH_SPEC §11. `make eval` + `make test`.
- Proven on a hand-written stub — **Phase 0 exit criterion met**. 12 tests, built test-first. Merged to `main`.
- Repo scaffolded to TECH_SPEC §12 (`src/`, `eval/`, `README.md`, `config.yaml`, `requirements.txt`).

## 2026-08-04 — Capture bring-up

- Camera capture validated: **90–96% frame delivery** over wifi RTSP (n=4), losses bursty (1–4 s stalls), on a clean network. Audio codec `pcm_alaw` → MKV container required.
- Decisions: wallclock timestamps (ADR-030), clean-stop recordings (ADR-031), prefer microSD once available (ADR-032), plus post-prototype ADRs 033–034.
- Added `STRATEGY.md` (multi-venue direction, exploratory). Sharpened the Phase 0.6 gate to name the two confounders (dink rallies, courtesy returns) and added far-court pose-reliability as a risk.
